# ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND IP
## Schumpeter’s hypotheses
Schumpeter was among the first who thought systematically about innovation with economic analysis.

Innovation in a broad sense: “doing things differently”:
		* Introduction of new commodities
		* New ways of producing old commodities
		* Opening up new markets for new products
		* Reorganising an industry

Innovation vs invention:
	* Invention involves scientific novelty
	* Innovation might or might not be related to an invention
	* Inventor vs entrepreneur: the inventor produces ideas, the entrepreneur gets things done

::Schumpeter Mark I:: 
		* In his lifetime (19th century), industries were characterised by large number oligopolies of early industrialisation
		* Entrepreneur = central to innovation
		* Typical entrepreneur was the man who puts in practice a novel method of production by embodying it in a new firm and settled down into a position of owner manager

1. He thought it was the **new firm** that carried out the innovation
2. As the firm becomes old/large -> inflexible -> model gets replaced by an entrepreneur who becomes the manager
3. Hypothesis of **creative destruction**

::Schumpeter Mark II:: 
His view changed in the 20th century: 
industry is charachterized by concentrated market structures -> big business has more to do with creating the standard.
Most of the cheap and simple inventions have been made -> development is more costly and complex;
it must be on sufficient scale so that successes and failures will average out -> few can afford it

3 Market Failures: Externalities, indivisibilities & uncertainty
* Larger firms are able to spread (fixed) costs of R&D over a larger sales base
* Larger firms can exploit economies of scale and scope R&D
* Larger diversified firms are more likely to exploit an unexpected discovery (-> serendipity)

+

Large firms
1. spread risk involved in R&D by undertaking many projects simultaneously 
2. have advantage in raising financing for R&D
3. have advantage in hiring skilled people

::Main conclusion:: Concentrated Supply Side market structure favours innovation

::Schumpeter today::
		* Ideas are debated
		* Incentives to innovate play an important role on technological progress and welfare
		* Policy makers have high interest in fostering the incentives to innovate


## The nature of innovation and R&D
Like any other investment -> innovation investment is characterised by:
1. investment in period t
2. expected profits in periods t+x

But: investment in R&D and innovation is different from other types of investment
		-> High sunk cost: hard to recoup investments
		-> Incomplete appropriability in returns
		-> Risky (uncertainty over project outcome)
		-> Costly to finance externally — reliance on internal funds
				* Low inside collateral value
				* High adjustment cost
				* Asymmetric information
				* If internal funds are not available and external to expensive, R&D will be constrained

### Types of innovations
What is an innovation? 
* Typically seen as an ultimate result of a creative process (R&D)
* R&D may lead to an invention -> when it gets commercialized -> innovation

::Product vs Process Innovation::
1. A product innovation is the generation, introduction and diffusion of a new product (process remains unchanged)
2. A process innovation is the generation, introduction and diffusion of a new production process (product remains unchanged)

Basic theories mainly focus on **process innovation as presented by a reduction in marginal cost**.

**Belleflamme/Peitz**: Product innovation is nothing but an extreme case of process innovation. The new product already existed but was simply to expensive to produce; so it took a process innovation to make the new product available.

::Drastic vs Non Drastic process innovation::
1. Drastic (major) process innovation: reduces the cost to such an extent that innovator can behave as monopolist
2. Non Drastic process innovation: rivals can still compete on the market

::Other types::
1. **Organisational Innovation**: 
new business practices, 
new methods of organising work responsibilities, 
new methods of organising external relations

2. **Marketing innovation**: implementation of new marketing methods
3. **Design innovation**


## Market Structures
**Key questions**:
* How do firms’ incentives to invest in R&D depend on the market structure they’re in
* What market structures are most conductive to innovation
* How does successful innovation affect market structure
* How does R&D investment decisions change

**Incentives to innovate**:
1. Increased profitability
2. Drastic innovation may lead to monopoly
3. How much would a firm be willing to invest in innovation
 -> depends on the market structure

### The Arrow model
More incentive to innovate in a competitive market than from a monopolist perspective!
**Tirole**: A competitive firm is willing to pay more than a monopolist because of the _replacement effect_.

**Replacement effect**: Prior to the innovation a monopolist already earned a positive profit -> innovation creates profits that replace already existent ones

=> Firms active on multiple markets tend to **direct/scope R&D towards more competitive markets**.

The innovation was minor as it did not eliminate competitive pressure. 
	-> A competitive firm places longer value on non-drastic process innovation than a monopolist does
Value for a competitive firm is smaller than the social value

::Arrow Model Assumptions::
1. No financing constraints
2. Innovations are external to the firm
3. Firm that bids more gets the innovation with certainty
4. No entry

Product innovation = more complicated:
* Even in competition a firm can earn profits offering a differentiated product -> replacement effect here as well
* Price discrimination

In case of heavy competition: drastic innovation; 
Non drastic innovation: competitive firm may still face a lower replacement effect and therefore have more incentive to innovate.


### Cournot Model
In case of:
1. Homogeneous good
2. Identical firms
3. Both firms supply the same market
4. Entry is impossible
5. Response

Can be interpreted as a non-cooperating game -> strategic interaction in terms of best response to rivals actions are necessary in order to maximise own profits.

**Lerner Index**: (also: Mark-up or price-cost margin): a firm can realise if the market is determined by demand elasticity; and its market share determined by its cost function.


### Gilbert/Newberry Auction Model
* Market with one incumbent: the monopolist
* Process innovation for sale -> incumbent firm is threatened by a challenger that also bids
* Question: Who bids more?

Result: Under certain circumstances the **monopolist has a greater incentive** than a competitive firm to bid for the patent **if the innovation is non-drastic**. 
-> Reverse of the Arrow result!

If the monopolist wins, it remains monopolist and earns monopoly profits. If it loses -> Market entry -> Duopoly
The monopolists’ incentive is Profit(monopoly) - Profit(duopoly)

**Efficiency Effect**: The fact a monopolist has incentive to stay monopolist. If the innovation is drastic either the monopolist or the challenger will become the new monopolist and consequently both would bid exactly the same (= all future monopoly profits)
	-> Explains the persistence of monopolies
	-> Monopolist preempts competition by innovation
	-> Monopoly position is prolonged through innovation

Even higher incentives for the incumbent firm if its products are close substitutes

E.g. 
1. Blocking Patents
2. Pay-for-delay agreements: Monopolist can pay entrants to delay entry as long as Profit(Mono) > 2*Profit(Duo)

::Gilbert/Newberry Assumptions::
* Firms that bids most always wins the patent
* Patent provides full protection against future competition
* Entrant that wins the patent cannot bargain with incumbent (no licensing)

### Patent Race model
Objective of R&D is to come up first with the innovation -> Firms do not buy innovation of price x, but rather decide how much to invest in R&D (h(x)) and when to do so. Combined influence of:
					1. Replacement effect
					2. Efficiency effect


### Reinganum
Shows that the preemption result of G/N model disappears when R&D follows a discovery process and in **every period there is only a certain chance to win the patent** + the innovation is drastic.

-> Incentive is low when the innovation is low, if the entrant is likely to succeed when (when innovation is drastic) the monopolist will invest at most the same.

Empirical question: Who has the most incentives to innovate? -> Important consequences for policy


### What makes good research?
Czarnitzki & Kraft find evidence in favour of the Patent Race model
	-> Incumbents invest less into R&D than challengers
	-> Results turn around for license expenditure: Incumbents invest more = auction model


### Summary

::Replacement Effect:: A monopolist has lower incentive to invest into a non-drastic innovation than a competitive firm as the former would cannibalise profits of its current market.

::Efficiency Effect:: A monopolist has higher incentive to spend on R&D protecting their market, than a challenger has to enter it when innovation is non-drastic and the products are close substitutes. When with uncertainty and drastic innovation the replacement effect prevails.


## R&D and Spillovers
Why is innovation so important?
(1) Technological change: Change in goods and services and how they are made
(2) R&D and innovation are priority area at EU level
(3) Important to understand underling economic attributes
(4) Central to technological change and welfare

Technological Change: Change in goods and services and how they are made
R&D: Commitment of resources to invention and innovation
		-> Main output is knowledge

### Knowledge Production
= Inherently uncertain: 
			1. Technological uncertainty
			2. Commercial uncertainty

= Associated with indivisibility:
			* High fixed cost
			* Low marginal cost of providing/distributing findings
			* Knowledge is reusable
		-> Average cost decrease with production increase: economies of scale

= Has public good characteristics: 
		* Non-rival
		* Only partially excludable
	
-> Positive externalities arise when firm cannot take fully into account its R&D investment results
				-> Social returns from innovation > private returns

::Various forms of externalities::
	
Positive: 
(1) Knowledge Spillovers
(2) Cumulative Invention
(3) Consumer Surplus (Welfare)

Negative:
(1) Environmental damage
(2) Business Stealing

(Positive outweigh the negative externalities)


### Spillover apropriabilities
* Copycat innovation
* Follow-on firms:
		* Carry out their own R&D
		* Avoid dead-end research
		* Reduces risk of failure
		* Saves time and cost

Appropriability in Flanders is a problem
	(1) Incomplete
	(2) Not fully solvable through legal protection (but helps)

Informal ways of apropriabilities
1. Secrecy
2. Lead time
3. Continuous innovation
4. Complexity
5. Marketing & Sales effort

**Secrecy**
* NDA
* Reduces spillovers
* More effective for process than for product innovations
* Good for for early stage

**Lead Time**
-> Time between concept and market introduction.
-> Faster = Competitive advantage

**Continuous innovation**
* Avoids catch-up from other firms
* Can lead to technological leadership position

**Complexity**
* Harder to replicate for outsiders
* Tacit knowledge is needed

Branding/marketing is at least as important as patenting (f.e. farma business)

::Spillover consequences::
(1) Beneficial from **social** POV
(2) Affect R&D investment **decision making**
(3) Absorb spillover firms through **absorptive capacity**
	-> To understand complex knowledge coming from elsewhere: Firms need to invest in own knowledge base


### Absorptive capacity
* R&D not only generates innovation but also develops the firms ability to identify, assimilate & exploit environmental knowledge
* Necessary to absorb spillovers and use them in own work
* The prospect to benefit more from spillovers increases R&D incentives
* Tacit knowledge is easier to appropriate
	-> Knowledge =/= information: knowledge requires R&D


### Market failures related to innovation

1. Limited appropriability of findings
2. Financing constraints

-> Leads to underinvestment from a social POV (market economy does not provide enough incentive to innovate)

 ::Limited appropriability::
Firm cannot appropriate all benefits:
	-> Positive externalities 
	-> Reduces incentive to engage in R&D
**Key Point:** Social returns from innovations > private returns

Dilemma: 
(1) Policies should enhance incentives for R&D
(2) Policies should encourage diffusion of knowledge (which reduces incentives)


 ::Financing Constraints::
		* Innovation requires investment
		* On average these pay off
			BUT -> Information problem leading to financial constraints
	=> **justification of government intervention**
	=> Policy makers goal: Identify constrained firms and alleviate underinvestment there


### Summary
Innovation matters -> Growth
Knowledge as good -> Externalities & indivisibilities
Absorptive Capacity -> Invest to absorb

Market failures in knowledge production:
		* Private Investment
		* Limited appropriability
		* Financial Constraints


## Innovation financing & subsidies
### Financing constraints
* Depend not only on the availability of internal funds
* Driven by innovation capacity
* High innovation capacity but low internal funds

::Heterogeneity of R&D::
Routine vs cutting edge R&D
Research vs development
Radical vs incremental

-> There is need for targeted innovation policy

::Market solutions::
1. VC industry
2. R&D collaboration
3. Patents & Licensing


### R&D subsidies to private R&D
How can a policy alleviate market failure?
			* Intellectual property rights
			* Direct R&D subsidies
			* Tax relief to reduce cost
			* Anti trust exemptions
			* Loans with low interest rates

R&D subsidies 
	reduce cost incurred of undertaking R&D
	reduce financing constraints
	increase R&D incentive
without reducing knowledge ex post.

::Problems::
		1. Efficiency of government intervention depends on two issues:
				1. Whether an appropriate instrument can be designed
				2. Whether the instrument is is implemented well
		2. Subsidies = selective tool: need for finding the right problems
		3. Which to choose? 
				1. Information problems
				2. Incentive problems

Government invention is justified but might not improve situation. 
To prevent government failure upon the situation: evaluate R&D subsidies


### Evaluation of R&D subsidies
What does the policy maker want to know?
		1. The effect of its subsidy
		2. Counter-factual questions:
				* How much would the firm have invested if they got subsidized
				* “ “ “ if they not got subsidized
		-> Evaluated through valid comparison group (accounting for selection bias by econometrics etc)


R&D subsidies in Flanders: 
	Firms are more likely to get funding if:
				* they are larger
				* received grants in the past 3 years
				* had more innovation succes
				* export to international markets

::Conclusions about subsidies::
(1) No full crowding out (influence on market is low)
(2) Governmental subsidy seems to increase R&D
(3) Most subsidies neglect cost for society
(4) Crucial is **net impact**


### R&D coorperation
-> Widespread

::Motivations::
		* Internalizes knowledge spillovers within consortium
		* Greater efficiency of R&D
		* Greater amount of information sources
	=> Larger more risky projects become feasible

Horizontal cooperations (-) 
Vertical cooperations (customers & suppliers)

When firms collaborate on R&D, they internalise the external effects through joint decision.
Higher industry output -> Lower customer prices -> Higher customer surplus + Welfare

Innovation and competing policy: 
		* Agreements between firms that contribute to technological progress
		* Block exemptions for R&D cooperation if the the combined market shares < 25%
		* Threat to break up collaboration could be punishment strategy to prevent tacit collusion in post-innovation market

-> Antitrust authorities must make sure that cooperation is limited to R&D activities.

::Effects of strategic behaviour::
	The strategic effect of an increase in the R&D of one firm on its own profit is… 
		under _quantity competition_
				negative for small spillovers
				positive for large spillovers 
		under _price competition_ always negative

**Jacquemin/D’aspremont Model**
When the bèta <0,5 it indicates that the amount of spillovers between the firms are small. According to the D’aspremont and Jacquemin model cooperation leads to less R&D than in a situation without cooperation.

When firms behave strategically, R&D co-operation leads to more (less) R&D when spillovers are large (small) (than in a situation without cooperation).
Spillovers are inversely related to level of patent protection.


## Intellectual Property Rights — IPR
### Characteristics of knowledge
		1. Knowledge as public good: 
				* Nonrival
				* Nonexcludable
				* Additional user =/= additional cost
				* f.e. open source software
		2. Knowledge as private good:
				* Each additional good imposes extra cost
				* Using a private good precludes others from using it
				* f.e. any good that requires physical resources for producing it

::Problem:: 
	Underinvestment in knowledge:
		Efficient competitive price for a public good is zero
			 	-> does not cover any R&D costs
				-> investor is not incentivised to develop
					  -> product is not made 
								-> underinvestment, no tech-progress, less welfare

::Solution::
	IPR
		1. Gives the creator exclusive rights for a period of time
		2. Provides protection for the results of investment
		3. A functioning intellectual property regime facilitates transfer of knowledge through foreign direct investment, JV’s, licensing

::The effects::
		* Increased producer surplus -> decreased consumer surplus
		* DWL = major shortcoming
		* Ex ante justification of IPR: incentive machines needed to induce inventions
		* Ex post defect: DWL: not all users are willing to pay -> limited “access”

::IPR Forms::
		1. Copyright: original creative or artistic forms: exists automatically
		2. Trademarks: distinctive identification of products & services: registered
		3. Registered design: external appearance: registration
		4. Trade Secrets: valuable information not known to the public


### Introduction to patents
_Up to 20 years of protection_
-> Incentive to innovate (grants protection)
-> Incentive to share knowledge (publish the invention’s details)

::Rights conferred by the patent::
			* Prevent others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing in the country were the patent was granted
			* Sell these rights or conclude licensing contracts
			* The patent does not grant the right to use the invention
			* Not a right to use, instead: gives the owner the right to stop anyone from making or using the invention without their consent
			* A patent search is indispensable


::What can be patented?::
			* Under the EPC patents are granted for any inventions in all fields of technology
				-> Provided they are new, involve an incentive step, susceptible of industrial application


::What is a new invention?::
			* At the date of filing at a patent application does not yet form part of “state of the art”
			* Under EPC, the first to file application will be entitled
			* Disclosure before filing will invalidate the patent application
			* NDA is needed


::What cannot be patented?::
			* Not considered inventions: 
					* Discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods
					* Aesthetic creations
					* Schemes, rules, methods of performing mental acts, doing business, programs of computers
			**BUT** this only applies if the claim relates to these activities as such
				->  a patent claim that includes a mix of both patentable, technical 
					and excluded, nontechnical subject matter can be filed after all

					* Inventions that contrary “ordre public” or morality
					* Plant or animal varieties or biological processes
					* Methods for treatments by surgery or therapy


::What must be disclosed in a patent?::
		1. Detailed description of at least one way of carrying out the invention
		2. Must be sufficiently clear to a person “skilled in the art”
		3. Published in the patent document so that anyone can benefit from it
	
	-> The disclosure of the invention in exchange for patent protection = patent bargain
	-> In exchange of the reward, owner signs a contract that forces him to publicly disclose the invention in order for others to build it


::What does a patent look like?::
		1. Bibliographic information
		2. Abstract
		3. Description
			* Prior art
			* Problems of prior art
			* Proposed solution
			* Advantages
		4. Claims
		5. Drawings

::Where can the patent be filed?::
(1) NPO: only valid in that country, non-nationals can apply, 12 month right of priority for international application
(2) EPO: applicants can choose countries and cost is determined based on amount of countries selected
(3) PCT: one initial application for 141 contracting states, international patent application procedure (can be done @ EPO)


_Can trade secrets form an alternative?_
Process innovation -> YES, BUT: can leak out, no protection (once disclosed it cannot be patented)
Other cases, continuous integration is a good alternative


### EU patenting procedure
**First stage**:
		* examination on filing and formalities
		* search report
		* publication of application and search report
**Second stage**: substantive examination by three examiners
**Granting (or not)**
**Post-granting events**

### Patents from an economic POV

::Legal Monopoly::
Patent gives the right to exclude others from use -> legal monopoly
Monopolies are in principle to be avoided -> DWL, Decrease in Consumer Surplus
Patent protection creates distortion of the free market


::Tech spillovers::
Patents are protecting the firm against any spillovers -> only bad for the inventor
Patents still allow some spillovers to be captured:
	-> Inventor discloses knowledge that gets shared over time
	-> Patent contains patentable and non-patentable info that is free to use
	-> Inventors get new ideas from reading existing patents
_Cumulativeness of knowledge_


::Patent Length::
Before expiration: monopoly pricing -> DWL
After expiration: Competition is possible (full tech spillovers)
-> Balance between incentives for innovators & welfare for society
-> Has been subject of several economic models
-> Renewals in order to keep patents alive


IPR alternatives: 
		* Prizes
		* Research funding
		* Procurement
		* Secrecy


### Nordhaus model
_What is the optimal patent length?_
**Goal**: Maximize social welfare with respect to duration of patent T

2 components of overall welfare:
		1. Surplus until expiration of patent at point T = patentee monopoly rent from licensing
		2. Surplus after expiration of patent at point = consumer surplus
	
Conclusions:
(1) Higher price elasticity -> Greater DWL -> Shorter optimal length
(2) Patent infers higher cost reduction -> Quadratically increased welfare loss -> Shorter length
(3) Lower degree of diminishing returns -> Longer patent life

Limitations of the Nordhaus model
		* Impossible to define individually
		* In most countries 20y
		* Model considers a single innovation by a single firm
		* No competition for the innovation
		* Breadth of patent matters: easy to invent around
		

## Hosted course: International Student Exchange Programs — ESP’s

### Background: Binary dependent variables
1. LPM y = B1 + B2.v1 + B3.v2+ B4.v3 + … + e, Estimation model: OLS, Coefficients show marginal effects
2. Non linear binary response model P(y=1|X) with X set of event variables, Estimation model: Probit, Logit, Coefficients do not show marginal effects!

**DiD Method** = Difference in Difference:
		* Method often used in economic research
		* Shows the impact of a treatment on an outcome variable
		* Can be used when we have observation over time

**Endogeneity problem** = Falsify assigning causality to a variable, when an unobserved factor explains the positive relationship -> solve with instrumental variables approach

### ESP’s 

::Reasons to go::
		* Opportunities to live abroad
		* Live abroad
		* Cultural knowledge
		* Language improvement
		* Meeting new people
		* Experience gaining
		* Self-development
		* Interesting academic host/program

::Barriers::
		* Financial cost
		* Personal Relationship
		* Lack of language skills
		* Lack of academic programs
		* Complicated selection program
		* Anxiety for the new frontier

::The effects::

1. Relationship between exchange students’ personal development
-> Positive with self confidence, serenity, decisiveness
-> Positive with language proficiency
-> Positive on communicative skills & problem-solving

2. Economic benefits
-> More likely to work abroad
-> Positive impact on labor market participation
-> Positive relation with starting salary (not causal)

3. The relationship between ESP’s and students’ academic performance
	= negative, but better fit within EU
	-> Motivation plays a role?

4. The relationship between ESP’s and jobs
 -> participation has a slightly negative relation (ESP student tend to take extra Master etc…)


## Innovation revisited

### Cumulative innovation
Important benefit: cumulative innovation boosts innovation
F.e. 
2nd could not happen without first -> Social value of first includes the second
Developing 2nd is cheaper with first -> Social value of first equals the cost reduction
Developing 2nd is faster with the first -> Social value of the first includes the second sooner

* Innovators learn from their predecessors.
* Difficult to compensate developers of basic tech
* Founder of ideas earns some profit mostly due licensing fees, but… 
* requires that later products infringe patents

::How should profit be divided?::
First requirement: innovators must jointly earn enough profit to cover development costs
But **profits need to be divided to incentive each step of the process** -> each contributing innovator should cover own cost

Types of cumulativeness:
(1) Basic & Applied research
(2) Research tools
(3) Quality ladder

Instruments to pass on profits from application to basic inventor: licensing, tax reduction, increased patent breadth… 
	-> Licensing works well if division of profit is sensitive to the costs
	-> Innovators should get net social value of the first stage + second stage - development costs of second stage

### Research tools
* 2nd innovations require inputs from several 1st generation innovations
* Combined price of multiple research tools can be so high that a 2nd generation user is excluded
* Can be explained by Cournot model type
	-> Assume products (tools) are complements
	-> Combined price means owners of the tools form a cartel => have incentives to deviate from the collusive price
			-> Solution = Research (patent) pools : registered users pay a fixed license fee to everybody (= contract cartel)
			-> Increases profits
			-> Decreases prices, DWL
			-> Increases welfare

### Qualitative ladder
	= series of products that improve on each other

* Disclosure of invention adds to knowledge base, increasing profitability of next improvement
* Best product held by incumbent is superseded by next iteration (not necessarily so in a production function model)
* **Issue:** How to make sure that profit flows are sufficient to cover the cost of innovation without discouraging rapid turnover?
* Model shortens _effective_ patent life
* Suppose: 
		* Rate of improvement is delta per year
		* Highest quality product is sold at p = delta
		* Social value is the delta divided by the discount rate
		* Net private value is delta min costs
		* In many cases: improvements in social value are absent because of lack of incentive
			-> **Solution:** Increase profit flow by incorporating leading breadth
			Patent breadth: degree up to which new products must be as not to infringe
			Broader patent -> More infringement -> More power for holder of the patent
			Leading breadth: patent gives rights on k future improvements (legal cases = difficult)

Follow in licensers must license original patenter.
